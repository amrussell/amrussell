<h4>Project Proposal</h4>
<p>
	I am thinking of creating an application for the purpose of archiving and comparing cars. The user may be able to add cars to his/her "garage," and compare their cars with others.
</p>

<h4>Main User</h4>
<p>A dude who has multiple cars and wants to archive and share his garage. Users can compare garages.</p>

<h4>Goals</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Users can upload entries and pictures corresponding to their real-life garage</li>
	<li>Users can compare their garages to others'</li>
	<li>Users can up- or downvote others' cars</li>
</ul>
